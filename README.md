# Python-For-Everybody
A collection of  Small projects working with basic Python functions as well as more complex avenues including SQL-based data browsing and file reading using URLlib and URLlinks. These were based on work I did for the Dr. Charles Severance's course Python For Everybody via the Freecodecamp website.
